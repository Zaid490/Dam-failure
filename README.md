The sediment transport caused by the flow of an extreme flood, such as the propagation of a dam failure, is being studied to simulate the hydrodynamic behaviour of the solid particles contained in the valley during the flood passage. With this intention, I have developed a numerical model which is based on the resolution of the one-dimensional Saint Venantâ€“Exner equations by the implicit finite difference scheme.
The HECRAS code, which is based on the implicit resolution of Saint Venant equations, was used to validate the simulation results. This model has allowed us to investigate flow fluctuations, water depths, flood extent, and the arrival time of the highest flow that creates maximum submersion heights.
