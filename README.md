A numerical model was used to assess the river flow from an extreme flood. The model is based on the resolution of the one-dimensional Navier Stokes equations by the implicit finite difference scheme. The simulation results are validated by using the HECRAS code, which is based on the implicit resolution of the Navier Stokes equations. This model has allowed us to investigate flow fluctuations, water depths, flood extent, and the arrival time of the highest flow that creates maximum submersion heights.
