A numerical model was used to assess the sediment transport caused by the flow of an extreme flood, such as the propagation of a dam. The model is based on the resolution of the one-dimensional Saint Venantâ€“Exner equations by the implicit finite difference scheme, and the HECRAS code, which is based on the implicit resolution of Saint Venant equations, was used to validate the simulation results. This model has allowed us to investigate flow fluctuations, water depths, flood extent, and the arrival time of the highest flow that creates maximum submersion heights.
